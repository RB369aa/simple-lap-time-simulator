- Lap Time Simulator

A simple Python program that simulates random lap times based on average speed and lap length.

---How it works
- You enter the number of laps, lap length, and average speed.
- The program randomly varies the speed each lap.
- It calculates and displays:
  - Average lap time
  - Fastest lap
  - Slowest lap

---Example
Enter the total number of laps: 71
Enter the length of one lap (km): 4
Enter the average speed (km/h): 150
The average lap time is 1.6 minutes
The fastest lap time is 1.53 minutes
The slowest lap time is 1.67 minutes
